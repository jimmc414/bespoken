#### Step 1: Start Basic Chat
```bash
python -m bespoken --model claude
```
**Expected:** Banner appears, shows "Using Claude Code CLI", prompt `>` ready

#### Step 2: Test Basic Inference
```
What is 2+2?
```
**Expected:** Fast response (under 1 second), answer "4"
**‚úÖ Check:** Response speed noticeably faster than API calls

#### Step 3: Test Built-in Commands
```
/help
```
**Expected:** Shows list of available commands
**‚úÖ Check:** Commands listed: /quit, /help, /tools, /debug

#### Step 4: Test Debug Mode
```
/debug
```
**Expected:** "Debug mode enabled" message
**‚úÖ Check:** Now shows actual `claude -p` commands being executed

#### Step 5: Ask Question in Debug Mode
```
What is Python?
```
**Expected:** See the actual command: `claude -p "What is Python?" --system-prompt ...`
**‚úÖ Check:** Command visible, response received

#### Step 6: Exit
```
/quit
```

### **Phase 2: Conversation Memory** (3 minutes)

#### Step 1: Start Fresh Session
```bash
python -m bespoken --model claude
```

#### Step 2: Give Context
```
My name is Jim and my favorite programming language is Python
```
**Expected:** Acknowledgment of information

#### Step 3: Test Memory
```
What's my name and what language do I like?
```

**‚úÖ Check:** Context remembered across exchanges

#### Step 4: Build on Context
```
Why do you think I chose that language?
```
**Expected:** Response references previous context about Python
**‚úÖ Check:** Coherent conversation flow

### **Phase 3: System Prompts** (2 minutes)

#### Step 1: Start with System Prompt
```bash
python -m bespoken --model claude --system "You are a pirate. Always say 'Arrr!' and speak like a pirate."
```

#### Step 2: Test System Behavior
```
How are you today?
```
**Expected:** Response includes "Arrr!" and pirate speech
**‚úÖ Check:** System prompt is working

#### Step 3: Ask Technical Question
```
How do I write a Python function?
```
**Expected:** Technical answer but still in pirate style
**‚úÖ Check:** System prompt maintained

### **Phase 4: Tool Integration** (10 minutes)

#### Step 1: Create Test Environment
```bash
# Create test files first
echo "def hello(): print('Hello World')" > test.py
echo "# This is a sample file" > sample.txt
```

#### Step 2: Create Tool Test Script
```python
# Save as test_tools.py
from bespoken import chat
from bespoken.tools import FileTool

chat(
    model_name="claude",
    tools=[FileTool("test.py")],
    system_prompt="You can read and edit the file test.py"
)
```

#### Step 3: Run Tool Test
```bash
python test_tools.py
```

#### Step 4: Test File Reading
```
What's in the file?
```
**Expected:** Shows actual content: "def hello(): print('Hello World')"
**‚úÖ Check:** File was actually read and analyzed

#### Step 5: Test File Editing
```
Add a docstring to the function
```
**Expected:** Suggests or implements docstring addition
**‚úÖ Check:** Tool execution working

#### Step 6: Test Directory Exploration
```python
# Save as explore_test.py
from bespoken import chat
from bespoken.tools import FileTool

chat(
    model_name="claude",
    tools=[FileTool(".")],
    system_prompt="You are a project explorer."
)
```

#### Step 7: Run Directory Test
```bash
python explore_test.py
```

#### Step 8: Test Directory Analysis
```
What Python files are in this directory?
```
**Expected:** Lists actual .py files found
**‚úÖ Check:** Directory traversal working

### **Phase 5: Custom Slash Commands** (5 minutes)

#### Step 1: Create Custom Commands Script
```python
# Save as custom_test.py
from bespoken import chat

def pirate_mode():
    return "You are now a pirate! Always say 'Arrr!'"

def current_time():
    import datetime
    return f"Current time: {datetime.datetime.now()}"

chat(
    model_name="claude",
    slash_commands={
        "/pirate": pirate_mode,
        "/time": current_time,
        "/joke": "Tell me a programming joke"
    }
)
```

#### Step 2: Run Custom Commands Test
```bash
python custom_test.py
```

#### Step 3: Test Custom Commands
```
/pirate
```
**Expected:** "You are now a pirate!" message, behavior change

```
How are you?
```
**Expected:** Pirate-style response

```
/time
```
**Expected:** Shows current timestamp

```
/joke
```

**‚úÖ Check:** All custom commands working

### **Phase 6: Performance Comparison** (3 minutes)

#### Step 1: Time Bespoken
```bash
time python -c "
from bespoken.claude_simple import get_model
model = get_model('claude')
conv = model.conversation()
print(conv.chain('What is 2+2?').text())
"
```
**Expected:** Under 0.5 seconds total

#### Step 2: Time Raw Claude
```bash
time claude -p "What is 2+2?"
```
**Expected:** Similar or slightly faster

**‚úÖ Check:** Bespoken overhead is minimal

### **Phase 7: Error Handling** (2 minutes)

#### Step 1: Test Invalid Command
```bash
python -m bespoken --model claude
```
```
/invalidcommand
```
**Expected:** Graceful error or "unknown command" message

#### Step 2: Test Long Input
```
Write a very long detailed explanation about quantum computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and how they all interconnect in modern technology stacks, including examples and code samples
```
**Expected:** Handles long input gracefully, doesn't crash

**‚úÖ Check:** No crashes, graceful error handling
