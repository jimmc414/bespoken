        # The Monty Hall Problem Analysis ðŸŽ²

    A famous probability puzzle: You pick one of 3 doors (car behind one, goats behind two). The host opens a door with a goat, then asks if you want to switch.

    **The counterintuitive answer:** Always switch! You get a **66.7%** chance of winning vs **33.3%** if you stay.

        Let's analyze the results of a simulation to understand this better.
