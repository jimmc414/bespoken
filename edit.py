        # The Monty Hall Problem Simulator ðŸŽ²

        A famous probability puzzle: You pick one of 3 doors (car behind one, goats behind two). The host opens a door with a goat, then asks if you want to switch.

        **The counterintuitive answer:** Always switch! You get a **66.7%** chance of winning vs **33.3%** if you stay.

        Use the controls below to see this in action!
